# mobile_atac_synchronizer
A simple app to synchronize songs from api-atac.

## How it works
We first calculate the difference by pressing the `Calculate Difference`-Button. The app then proceeds
to scan its own files directory `com.open0x20.mobile_atac_synchronizer/files/` and `/storage/3735-3531/Music/`.
The difference is then being displayed in a log-like manner.

If there is a difference you can press the `Download`-Button und look at the app downloading the songs for you.
